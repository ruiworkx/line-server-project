To test what I did:

ran npm install (which is in build.sh also)
I created a script file-generator, that duplicates the contents of the file 6mbfile.txt a 100 times (ending in a 600mb file) by running node ./file-generator.js
a largerfile.txt is created.
then i ran: run.sh largerfile.txt
This preprocesses the file first, creating an index file, and after that it starts the API.
to test it i ran: curl.exe http://localhost:3000/lines/167 for example
